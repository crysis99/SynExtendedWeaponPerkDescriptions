Battleaxes become Battleaxes, Scythes, Halberds if Scythe and Halberd weapons are found.\r\nWhich base class it belongs to is hardcoded, and I based it primarily off of Animated and Heavy Armouy.\nDo not use with ANY mod that adds extra weapons to perk descriptions already, I don't do checks for that and it will duplicate.
